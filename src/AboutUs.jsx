            <p>Saguna Baug started in the late 1960â€™s as a dream of Gandhian freedom fighter, who was popularly known as Shri Harikaka Bhadsavle. His dream was to set up a strong farming base that would effectively support his family and set an example for all in agricultural self-sustenance.</p>
            <p>Today hundreds flock to find happiness in this beautiful agricultural project which is ever-evolving, yet still takes us back to our roots.</p>
            <p>Come and stay at our farm, enjoy our agricultural tours, the serenity of the river, the culture and traditional art forms of our villages and the fun activities we provide.</p>
            <p>Located just 1.5 hours from Mumbai, Saguna Baug spreads over 16 hectares of land in Malegaon-Neral of the Raigad district in Maharashtra.</p>
